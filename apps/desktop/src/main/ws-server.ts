/**
 * Localhost WebSocket push server (SSOT §5.6 / Step 1.9). Aux windows — the
 * overlay from Step 2.10 — subscribe here for push-only telemetry. Hard rules:
 *  - binds LOOPBACK only (127.0.0.1), on an OS-assigned ephemeral port;
 *  - authenticates with a high-entropy per-launch token carried in the
 *    `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` subprotocol — never a query param, never logged;
 *  - every frame is a §5.6 Envelope, JSON-encoded; the server only ever pushes.
 * Lifecycle is owned by the app main (start before any subscriber window; the
 * returned handle's `close()` is called on shutdown).
