 * hash-verified first-run downloads and is never reachable from runtime code.
 * AI/ML inference hosts are permanently absent from both — enforced by the
 * compliance suite (Step 0.11).
 *
 * Allowlists are exposed as frozen `.has()`-only objects, NOT bare Sets, so
 * they cannot be mutated at runtime to add a host (freezing a Set does not stop
 * `.add()`/`.delete()`, so a real Set would be a false guarantee).
